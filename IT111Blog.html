            <h1>Learnings every Lesson</h1>
            <br> 
            <p> Chapter 1: What is Computing? 
                -In this lesson, I have learned that computing is about using machines to process information. 
                Computing can also have an impact on different industries. 
                I've also learned about the development of computers from the mechanical era to the PC and VLSI era.
            </p>
            <p> Chapter 2: Professions and Careers in Computing 
                -In this lesson, I have learned that there are a lot of professions related to this course. 
                These professions or career can be categorized into 8 groups: programming and software development, information systems operation, and management, telecommunications and networking, computer science research, graphics, andmultimedia, web, and internet, and training and support
            </p>
            <p> Chapter 3: Information Processing Cycle 
                -In this lesson, I have learned that the information processing cycle refers to the order of events that go into processing information, including input, processing, storage, and out. 
                I have also discovered that there is a difference between data and information. 
                Data is the representation of facts and concepts in a formalized manner suitable for communication. 
                While information is organized data that has a meaningful meaning to the receiver,
            </p>
            <p> Chapter 4: Computer Systems
                -In this lesson, I have learned that a computer system is a systematic interaction between entities, procedures, and activities.
                 Moreover, there are 4 computer components: software, hardware, dataware, and peopleware. </p>
            <p> Chapter 5: Concept of Computer Security
                -In this lesson, I have learned the basic concepts of computer security, classifying information, cyberattack countermeasures, the different types of cybercrimes, and cybercriminals. 
                Moreover, I have discovered that there are many different kinds of hackersâ€”some good, some bad. </p>
            <p> Chapter 6: HTML and CSS 
                -In this lesson, I have learned how to code HTML and CSS with the guidance of our instructor, especially by efficiently teaching the HTML tags and CSS syntax. 
                I've also learned how to create a wireframe and a mockup for a website.
             </p>

            <div class="box">
            <h1>Favorite Lesson</h1>
            <br> 
            <p>My favorite lesson is HTML and CSS because it is interactive and engaging.
                These technologies are indeed fundamental to web development, providing the essential tools for creating the structure, content, and visual style of websites. 
                However, I find the CSS confusing because I have trouble making adjustments and struggle to understand some of its technical terms.
